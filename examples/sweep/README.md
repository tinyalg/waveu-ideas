# Sweep Example

This example demonstrates sweep wave generation using Waveu.
CH0 performs a linear sweep, and CH1 performs an exponential sweep over 20 seconds.
Both start at 100Hz, reach 1kHz, and then repeat.

## How to Build
Follow the steps in the [Root README](../../README.md).

## What Does the Waveform Look Like?
Visit the [Waveu Site](https://waveu.tinyalg.be/) and navigate to "Sweep Wave" on the left pane to view sample images and descriptions.
